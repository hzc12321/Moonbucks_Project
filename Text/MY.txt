KUALA LUMPUR: The year 2022 will see Malaysia back on track in setting a long-term national economic plan with the mobilisation of several important themes, according to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob.

These include empowering the digital economy as demanded by the current reality, he said in his special New Year’s message today.

“Based on the same awareness on the need to adapt to current and future requirements, Malaysia has also given its commitment towards achieving a carbon-neutral nation status by 2050.

“The year 2022 will see Malaysia back on the economic track for the long term, taking into consideration several important themes,“ the premier said in his address.

Among them is strengthening the digital economy in line with the current reality,

“We realise that we need to adapt to the current needs as well as for the future and Malaysia has given the commitment to achieve ‘carbon neutral nation’ status in 2050.

“The transformation to an economy and society that care about environmental, social and governance (ESG) need a transition in various aspects of management, administration and frame of mind in making policy,“ he added.

Ismail Sabri said for example, in terms of job creation, Malaysia needs to be ready to create an ecosystem that is capable of generating activities and a job market in line with an economy and society that are ESG-friendly.

The ESG aspiration will also need the government to be brave to create a conducive policy and incentive framework, he noted.

“Proof that the government is committed to this agenda is the exemption of various duties and taxes, such as road tax and sales tax, on electric vehicles (EV).

“The government realises that to achieve this objective, the support ecosystem such as infrastructure for EV needs to be set up and enhanced like what you find in developed countries,“ Ismail Sabri said.

The government will step up the economic recovery in 2022 with the implementation of various initiatives which had been announced in the 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP) and Budget 2022 to ensure the resiliency of the economy and the prosperity of Keluarga Malaysia, he added.

The government will also focus on creating at least 600,000 jobs and fast-track the recovery of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

Hence, Ismail Sabri said he is confident that the economy will grow between 5.5 and 6.5 per cent in 2022, in line with the IMF’s forecast of 6 per cent and the World Bank’s 5.8 per cent.

The year 2021 witnessed several positive indicators in the government’s effort to mend the economy, he noted.

Among them was that total trade breached RM2 trillion for the first time from January to November 2021, compared to the corresponding period a year ago.

Also, Malaysia recorded RM12.8 billion in net foreign direct investment (FDI) in the third quarter compared with RM8.2 billion in the second quarter, an improvement of 56 per cent.

“Net FDI in the first nine months of 2021 hit over RM30 billion,“ he noted, adding that the unemployment rate has also been recovering, hitting 4.3 per cent in October of 2021, compared with the peak of 5.3 per cent in May of 2020. - Bernama

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global
phenomenon. The virus is being transmitted at a worrying speed,
infecting millions of people and causing economic activity to almost
halt as countries take measures in mitigating the spread of the
virus. The emergence of new variants namely Delta and Omicron
threaten the trajectory of global economic recovery.
Although Malaysia encountered a high infection rate of COVID-19
in 2021, the country's economic performance is showing signs of
revival along with the progressive vaccination rates towards herd
immunity. A total of 26.0 million people have received at least
one dose of the vaccine while 25.6 million people have been fully
vaccinated. This brings the full vaccination rate to 78.5 per cent.
Additional booster shots were initiated on 22 November 2021,
and to date, a total of 6.9 million people have received them.
WORLD’S ECONOMY
2021 was an afflicted year for the world in its endeavours to
revive the slumped economy since the emergence of COVID-19.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected global economic
growth of 5.9 per cent in 2021 after recording a 3.1 per cent
drop in the previous year (IMF, October 2021), which was the
second sharpest economic downturn since World War II.
The recovery of the world economy is estimated in light of the
development of vaccination programmes around the globe that
restore confidence, as well as the wide-ranging economic
reopening. The strengthening of prospects among commodityexporting countries of the Emerging Market and Developing
Economies also contributed to the overall global economic growth
during the year.
Nevertheless, global inflation, supply disruptions in developed
countries, and worsening COVID-19 virus transmission with the
newly evolved mutations, notably in low-income developing
countries, are the downside risks that threaten the global economic
reconstruction, further driving the economy to grow below the
projection in 2021. The global economy is expected to remain
beneath the pre-pandemic peaks for a long period (World Bank,
June 2021).

According to the regional group, the 2021 Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) in Europe is projected to surge by 5.4 per cent, mainly
driven by the Euro Area and the United Kingdom (UK). While the
United States of America (USA) is forecasted to advance at a rate
of 6.0 per cent. Meanwhile, countries in the Asian region are
expected to chalk up by 6.5 per cent with China and India
growing above the group growth average. However, the ASEAN5 that comprises Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and
Malaysia is estimated to grow slower at 2.9 per cent. Other
regions such as the Middle East and Central Asia and SubSaharan Africa are projected to grow by 4.1 per cent and 3.7
per cent respectively.
MALAYSIA’S ECONOMY
Towards the end of 2021, a livelier economy is expected to be
seen in Malaysia as most states transition to Phase Four of the
National Recovery Plan (NRP). Based on the first nine-month
performance in 2021, Malaysia’s economy grew by 3.0 per cent
compared to a negative 6.4 per cent in the same period in 2020.
However, the level of national GDP attained in 2021 is expected
to be 3.8 per cent below the pre-pandemic projection (the first
nine months of 2019), apart from the Manufacturing Sector which
registered a value added of RM245.4 billion in 2021 compared
to RM234.6 billion (2019).
The Services, Manufacturing, and Mining & quarrying sectors
showed positive growth in the three quarters of 2021 where the
Services sector grew by 1.4 per cent. This growth was supported
by the Finance and Insurance (12.5%) subsector and Information &
Communication (6.1%).
The Manufacturing sector expanded by 9.7 per cent, driven by
export-oriented industries which grew by 12.1 per cent. The main
subsector that drove the growth were Petroleum, chemicals, rubber
& plastic products (15.3%).
The Mining & quarrying sector also recorded a growth of 1.3 per
cent. This performance was driven by the Natural gas subsector
which increased to 7.6 per cent. The Construction and Agriculture
sectors showed better growth although they remained negative at
2.6 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively. This was driven by the
Specialised construction activities (25.2%) and the Other
agriculture subsector (5.9%), respectively.
On the demand side, the performance of the first nine months of
2021 for Private Final Consumption Expenditure recorded a
growth of 1.3 per cent compared to a negative 4.6 per cent in
2020, while Government Final Consumption Expenditure increased
by 7.7 per cent. However, Gross Fixed Capital Formation
recorded a growth of negative 0.02 per cent, recovering from a
negative 15.3 per cent in the previous year.
The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the country’s economy,
especially the Tourism industry. However, this situation is
straightened out by the Information and communication technology
(ICT) industry that rose due to the implementation of the Movement
Control Order (MCO). The contribution of ICT to the economy in
2020 was RM320.0 billion with a double-digit growth of 10.4 per
cent compared to 7.3 per cent in the previous year. The digital
economy continues to shine as businesses begin to shift to digital
platforms and e-commerce, further showing positive developments
despite the country facing severe challenges following the
COVID-19 pandemic.

TRADE SUBSECTOR
The Wholesale & Retail Trade subsector began to show recovery
in June 2020 aftershocks that occurred in April and May following
the outbreak of COVID-19 earlier in that year. The
implementation of the MCO on 18 March 2020 which resulted in
the restriction of many economic activities has had a significant
impact on this subsector whereby sales declined 35.2 per cent in
April 2020.
On a year-on-year basis, this subsector showed a significant
recovery in April 2021, registering total sales of RM111.1 billion
as compared to RM66.9 billion recorded in the same month of the
previous year. The good performance was due to the base effect
from the very steep fall in April 2020, the first whole month of
MCO. All subsectors showed a significant increase, namely Retail
Trade which increased by RM16.0 billion; followed by Wholesale
Trade at RM15.3 billion and Motor Vehicles at RM13.0 billion.
Nevertheless, the increasing momentum declined slightly in June
and July 2021 following the re-implementation of the MCO due to
a significant increase in COVID-19 cases. The Motor Vehicles
subsector was the most affected with sales registered at RM925.3
million in June 2021 as compared to RM11.6 billion recorded in
the previous month.
For the first ten months of 2021, sales of the Wholesale and Retail
Trade subsector rose 3.8 per cent, registering RM1.1 trillion as
compared to RM1.0 trillion in the same period last year. This was
mainly contributed by the increase in the Wholesale Trade and
Retail Trade subsectors by 6.6 per cent to RM527.8 billion and
4.3 per cent to RM437.4 billion respectively. However, the Motor
Vehicles subsector declined by 11.0 per cent to record RM96.1
billion.
MANUFACTURING
The Industrial Production Index (IPI) in the first 10 months of 2021
recorded an increase of 7.3 per cent as compared to the same
period of the previous year (Jan. - Oct. 2020: -5.2%). The
expansion of IPI was driven by all sectors: Manufacturing index
(9.4%), Electricity index (1.9%) and Mining index (1.8%)
(Chart 4).
The increment recorded in Manufacturing sector was driven by
exports-oriented output which grew by 11.7 per cent while
domestic-oriented output increased by 4.5 per cent. The largest
contributor to the Manufacturing sector was Petroleum, chemical,
rubber & plastic products (14.8%), Electrical & electronics
products (14.0%) and Non-metallic mineral products, basic metal
& fabricated metal products (3.0%).
The sales value of Manufacturing sector registered an increase of
15.1 per cent (Jan. - Oct. 2020: -3.3%) amounted to RM1,268.5
billion as compared to the same period of 2020. The increase was
attributed by Petroleum, chemical, rubber & plastics products
(28.2%), Electrical & electronics products (13.7%) and Food,
beverages & tobacco products (11.2%). The number of employees
engaged during the period rose by 2.4 per cent (Jan. - Oct.
2020: -2.3%) to register 2.24 million persons while salaries &
wages paid increased by 2.6 per cent (Jan. - Oct. 2020: -1.1%)
to RM74.2 billion.

EXTERNAL SECTOR - MERCHANDISE TRADE
Malaysia’s total trade hit RM2 trillion mark for the first time in
history, surged 24.6 per cent in the period of 11 months of 2021
compared to a 4.2 per cent decrease noted in the same period of
2020. Exports and imports soared by 25.7 per cent to RM1,116.0
billion and 23.3 per cent to RM894.4 billion, respectively. The
increase in exports was attributed to higher exports of Electrical &
electronics (E&E) products (+RM56.2 billion, +16.1%), Refined
petroleum products (+RM31.1 billion, +63.6%), Palm oil & palm
oil-based products (+RM30.9 billion, +47.7%) and Rubber gloves
(+RM21.2 billion, +67.7%). Meanwhile, the main contributors to
the rise in imports were E&E Products and Refined Petroleum
Products with increases of RM54.2 billion (+23.6%) and RM25.3
billion (+48.9%), respectively. The significant expansion of
Malaysia’s trade was observed especially in the second quarter of
2021 with exports and imports boosted by 44.0 per cent and
33.3 per cent, respectively attributable to the low base in
corresponding period of previous year and better external
demand along with the global economic growth and health
recovery.
PRODUCER PRICE INDEX (PPI)
Malaysia’s Producer Price Index (PPI) experienced a slowdown
due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic which started in
February 2020. The PPI decreased from 107.4 point in December
2019 to hit a low of 99.7 point in May 2020 and the index
climbed to 105.1 point in December 2020. The PPI started the
year 2021 at 107.2 point and by February 2021, the index
breached the pre-pandemic level (December 2019) at 108.8
point and has since continued its uptrend momentum to reach a
high of 116.3 in November 2021. This scenario was attributed to
the rise in commodities prices (oil palm & petroleum) and electrical
& electronic on the back of strong global demand as most
developed countries open up their economy.
The PPI for the period January until November 2021 recorded a
growth rate of 9.4 per cent compared to a negative 2.7 per cent
in 2020. This growth was influenced by the increment in the
Agriculture, forestry & fishing and mining sectors which grew at
32.3 per cent and 40.8 per cent respectively. Meanwhile, the
Manufacturing sector recorded a growth of 5.3 per cent and the
Water supply sector grew at a slower pace of 0.5 per cent. On
the other hand, Electricity and gas supply was the only sector that
recorded negative growth of 0.5 per cent.

LABOUR MARKET
The year 2021 had seen uneven recovery of Malaysia’s labour
force situation amid a continuous battle against COVID-19
pandemic. Employment continued to record gradual increases in
2021 as compared to 2020. In March 2021, employment rose to
15.33 million persons which surpassed the 15.29 million marked as
of the end of 2019. Looking at the average number of
employment for ten months in 2021, the number edged up 1.5 per
cent as against 2020. Albeit, the increase was not as high as the
growth recorded during the pre-pandemic. In relation to this, the
implementation of the National Recovery Plan (NRP) and
acceleration of the population vaccination during the second half
of the year had also supported a better employment situation and
subsequently the number stood at 15.55 million as of October
2021. In the meantime, unemployment rate remained above 4.0
per cent throughout 2021. After a gradual month-on-month
decline to 4.5 per cent in May 2021, the rate peaked to 4.8 per
cent in June as most economic activities came to a halt due to full
lockdown. Amid transitions and progress made throughout the NRP
period, unemployment rate continued to trend down ever since
August and subsequently posted 4.3 per cent in October 2021,
the lowest rate since April 2020. Nevertheless, the unemployment
rate remained higher than between 3.2 to 3.4 per cent recorded
in 2019.
Meanwhile, on the demand side, total jobs in economic sector were
still lower than 8.66 million jobs recorded in 2019. Nevertheless,
quarter-on-quarter, the number trend up to 8.41 million jobs as of
the third quarter of 2021. The number of vacancies which
reflected jobs opening also remained lower than the quarterly
average of 205 thousand jobs vacancies in 2019, recording
174.0 thousand job vacancies in the third quarter of 2021.
Towards the end of 2021, the labour market is set to gain
recovery momentum as reflected by the labour force situation in
October 2021.

MALAYSIA’S ECONOMY
Malaysia Economic Outlook 2022 (MoF) reported that Malaysia’s
growth trajectory for 2022 is forecast to expand in the range of
5.5% – 6.5% (Table 3). Four economic sectors are projected to
expand on the supply side, led by the Services and Manufacturing
sectors, accounting for more than 80% of the economy. The
normalisation of economic activities underpinned by mass
vaccination is anticipated to boost Services sector especially
Wholesale and retail trade subsector and domestic tourismrelated activities. The projected growth of Manufacturing sector is
also in line with the expected rising demand from export-oriented
industries with gradual improvement.
Overall, the projections of economic growth are based on further
expansion in global and domestic economic activities, fuelled by
progressive vaccination rates amid losses in the large scale floods
at the end of 2021. Nonetheless, the domestic demand recovery is
also projected anchored by private consumption, following the
gradual improvement in the labour market and consumer
sentiments. Stronger external demand, especially for electrical
and electronics (E&E) products and major commodities, is expected
to support the surge in exports.

NEAR TERM ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
A more determined outlook in the near future is anticipated in line
with the easing of COVID-19 containment measures that allow the
resumption of economic activities. This is reflected by the
favourable performance of the Leading Index (LI) with the index
level remained above 100.0 points in October 2021. The LI's
annual growth increased by 0.3 per cent to reach 109.5 points. In
view of businesses, they are expecting a strong business
performance over the next six months (October 2021 to March
2022) as indicated by Business Tendency Statistics. The positive
vibe is reflected by the overall net balance which jumped to
+24.1 for the period October 2021 to March 2022 compared to
-21.7 recorded for the period July to December 2021. However,
the recent floods could have led to supply chain disruption and
caused significant losses to businesses in the affected areas. This
incident is indirectly expected to affect production in the said
area.
ECONOMIC PROSPECT 2022
LABOUR MARKET PROSPECT
More economic, social, and recreational activities had resumed
since all states had transitioned to Phase 4 of the NRP. The
relaxation of interstate travel is anticipated to have a significant
impact on domestic tourism-related industries including arts,
entertainment, and recreation, as well as transportation activities,
allowing them to restore business momentum. On top of this,
various programmes and initiatives have been introduced in
assisting the affected groups. Furthermore, the Malaysian
government’s Budget 2022, which among others focuses on
rejuvenating the labour market restoring business capabilities,
generating and retaining jobs as well as increase social protection,
may support the businesses as well as employees, hence
accelerating the recovery of the labour market. These positive
developments have steered further resumption of economic activity
in Malaysia, which may boost labour demand and lead to the
creation of more job opportunities, hence laying the foundation for
continuous labour market recovery. Concerning this, MoF through
Malaysia Economic Outlook 2022 projected that employment will
rise by 2.3 per cent to 15.5 million in 2022 while unemployment
rate is expected to fall to 4.0 per cent.
Nevertheless, the recent devastating flood that hit the central and
east coast regions of the country may attribute to slower recovery
considering the high concentration of economy and employment
especially in Selangor and W.P. Kuala Lumpur. On another note,
WHO’s warning on the rising number of new COVID-19 cases due
to Omicron variant may also post a challenge towards recovery
efforts.

KUALA LUMPUR (Oct 29): The country's economic growth is expected to accelerate to 5.5%-6.5% in 2022 from 3%-4% in 2021, boosted by the continuation of the various stimulus and assistance packages to combat Covid-19.

The growth trajectory in 2022 will also be based on expectations of further expansion in global and domestic activities, fuelled by broader vaccine coverage and a further improvement in goods trade amid a slower recovery in services trade, said the Ministry of Finance in its 2022 Fiscal Outlook report.

For 2021, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 3% to 4% represents a rebound from the economic contraction in 2020, which saw it contract 5.6% due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The domestic economy expanded 7.1% in the first half of 2021. The economic growth is expected to continue especially in the fourth quarter with the reopening of more economic and social sectors.

"Nevertheless, the favourable outlook is predicated on other factors, including the successful containment of the pandemic, effective National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme implementation, and strong global economic prospects," cautioned the report.

All expenditure items of the GDP are expected to see growth, said the report. Domestic demand is expected to expand by 6.6% in 2022.

Private consumption is expected to anchor domestic demand recovery, as it is forecast to increase by 7.3% in 2022, compared with 4.1% in 2021.

The expansion is anticipated to be supported by higher disposable income and better employment prospects, following a broad-based economic recovery. Improvement in consumer confidence and positive wealth effect on the back of a recovery of the stock market are also anticipated to stimulate private consumption spending.

Private investments in 2022 are expected to increase 2.6% compared with 1.4% in 2021. This comes as the government intends to move to promote high quality investments in high-technology, high value added, knowledge intensive and innovation-based industries.

Meanwhile, public expenditure is expected to increase 7.3% in 2022 compared with 1.6% in 2021. This will be led by public investments, which will see growth of 24.1% compared with the projected 1.9% contraction in 2021.

The increase in public investment will stem from the capital layouts of projects, such as the continuation of large-scale transportation projects, such as the Mass Rapid Transit Line 2 (MRT 2), LTR3, Johor-Singapore Rapid Transit System and Pan Borneo Highway. It also will see new projects such as MRT3 and upgrading of Klang Valley Double Track Phase 2.

There is also expectation of stronger external demand, especially for the electrical and electronics (E&E) products and major commodities, seen to support the surge in exports, which will help maintain a surplus in the current accounts.

Gross exports are expected to increase by 1.5% across all sectors in 2022 while gross imports are forecast to increase by 1.7% on account of higher demand in intermediate, capital and consumption goods.

The country is also forecast to record a current account surplus of RM55.6 billion, or 3.5% of gross national income, which is in line with continuous recovery in industrial and investment activities.

KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 4 — After two years of fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, the Malaysian economy is coming out of its economic trough in 3Q 2021 and is on the path to recovery in 2022, Socio-Economic Research Centre (SERC) executive director Lee Heng Guie said.

Lee said this is supported by the reopening of economic and social sectors. The worst floods in decades in some states have tempered the recovery in late December 2021 and early 2022.

“We estimate real gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 5.2 per cent in 2022, an improvement from estimated 3.4 per cent in 2021,” he said today.

“A sustained revival of consumer spending, aided by a gradual recovery in the labour market (jobless rate at 4.3 per cent in October 2021 versus 5.3 per cent in May 2020) and the anticipated strong bounce back in public investment via high allocation of development expenditure (RM75.6 billion) in 2022 will underpin a firmer economic recovery.

“However, we caution that rising cost of building materials and weak public implementation capacity as well as the shortage of workers could delay the implementation of projects, resulting in slow disbursement of funds,” he said.

According to Lee, SERC found that since the economic reopening, general mood and sentiment are positive as consumers were allowed interstate travels, and aided domestic tourism.

“People mobility and traffic indicators have been showing signs of revival amid wary about the Omicron Covid-19 virus variant.

“Retail, recreation, grocery, and shopping malls as well as workplace visits moved higher.

“Hotel occupancy rates have improved to around 40 to 50 per cent in recent months, thanks to a resumption of interstate travels and local tourists,” said Lee.

Lee also noted that the revival of international tourist arrivals (an average of 26.1 million per year in 2015 to 2019 and generated foreign exchange earnings of RM80.7 billion per year in the same period) is deemed necessary to sustain firmer tourism and related services.

“Businesses are slowly returning back to normality as business owners are eager to restart and resume back to the pre-Coivid-19 pandemic state.

“The manufacturing sector will continue its growing momentum amid facing constraints from the supply chain disruptions and workers shortage.

“Output of agriculture sector will be supported by production of palm oil, and rubber as well as fisheries amid the shortage of workers and increased cost of fertilisers and animal feed as well as the impact of climate change,” he said.

In addition, the ongoing public infrastructure projects as well as the implementation of new projects and approved manufacturing projects will help to turnaround the construction sector from a slump in 2020 to 2021, he said.

However, SERC found that the mining and quarrying sector is expected to remain weak on lower crude oil and condensates production, following the scheduled shut down of oil and gas plants and facilities for maintenance.

“We expect exports to normalise to estimated 1.8 per cent in 2022 (estimated 24.5 per cent in 2021) as growth will moderate from a high base level averaging RM102.0 billion per month in 2021.

“There remains lingering uncertainty over global growth due to the Omicron variant, global supply chain disruptions are also likely to persist into the first half of 2022, due to the time for bottlenecks to ease and production capacity to ramp up.

“The shortage of workers and increased cost of raw materials also dampened the pace of production,” said Lee.

WHEN the 2022 Budget was presented by the finance minister, a gross domestic product (GDP) growth expectation of between 5.5% and 6.5% for this year was pencilled in. Based on estimates from 17 economists covering the Malaysian economy, the consensus estimate of between 4.8% and 6.5% appears to be in line with the government’s projections.

Although the economy expanded by only 3.1% in 2021 and remained below the 2019 GDP value in real terms, the economy returned to pre-pandemic figures as nominal GDP expanded by 9% to reach RM1.54 trillion, exceeding the 2019 output level of RM1.51 trillion. More astonishing was the fact that the economy in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2021 rose by 12.1% year-on-year (y-o-y) to reach RM424.3 billion – the highest ever quarterly GDP value in nominal terms.

Economic data is showing increasing strength, not only from the external front, but on the domestic front as well. Total exports for the first two months of 2022 hit RM213.3 billion, up 20.4% y-o-y. Growth in imports was respectable as total imports for the same period were higher by 22.6% y-o-y to RM175.0 billion. As a result, total trade surged 21.4% y-o-y to hit RM388.3 billion, and the trade surplus improved by 11.2% y-o-y to reach RM38.3 billion.

Higher minimum wage of RM1,500 a month seen positively

The prime minister announced that the minimum wage for employees will be raised from RM1,200 to RM1,500 a month with effect from May 1, 2022. A higher wage structure will not only result in an increase in disposable income for the B50 group, but also help to boost the economy as well, as typically, the increase in wages will result in higher consumer spending.

With total Compensation to Employees (CE) in the region of RM526.7 billion based on the 2020 full-year statistics, a 5% increase in the overall wage bill for employees will help the government to achieve the CE-to-GDP ratio from the 37.2% that was recorded in 2020 to 39%, ceteris paribus, and closer to the target of 40% that the government intends to achieve by 2025 under the 12th Malaysia Plan.

In addition, the higher disposable income of RM26.3 billion, which is equivalent to about 1.7% of last year’s nominal GDP, can accelerate the pace of economic growth via higher consumer demand.

Malaysia’s economic data shows positive trend

Domestically, indicators are also strong for other industries as rising commodity prices, which have helped both the oil and gas sector and the plantation sector, are propelling consumption and domestic demand. The February 2022 IHS Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 50.9, which suggests that Malaysia’s engine of growth, the manufacturing sector, is back on its feet. Based on IHS Markit’s formula in studying the correlation between PMI prints and GDP growth, the February PMI print translates into a GDP growth of 5.6%.

Rising core inflation

Similar to the global inflationary pressure, Malaysia is also facing a similar headwind, mainly due to the low base effect as well as supply disruptions. Worse, the rise in headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) has also resulted in higher core inflation, while the Producer Price Index (PPI) has been on a tear, despite some easing passed three months after hitting 13.2% y-o-y growth in September 2021. While this has not manifested itself into higher-end product prices on a broad basis, a sustained increase in PPI could pressure CPI to rise in the months to come.


Foreign direct investment (FDI) at all-time high

Based on statistics provided by the Malaysian Investment Development Authority, Malaysia recorded a total approved FDI valued at RM208.6 billion for 2021, more than triple the previous year’s total of RM64.2 billion. The manufacturing sector took in the lion’s share of approved FDI, with RM179.6 billion or 86.1% of the total while the services and the mining industries saw approved investments amounting to RM24.9 billion and RM4.1 billion respectively. Meanwhile, data from Bank Negara shows FDI inflow of RM194.5 billion, up 39.5% y-o-y while FDI outflow expanded at a slower pace, rising by 11.9% y-o-y to reach RM139.6 billion, thus resulting in net FDI of RM54.9 billion in 2021, the highest ever recorded.

Ringgit – a relatively stable currency

As the dollar has been riding on strong momentum, on the back of expectations that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates aggressively this year and into 2023, the ringgit has performed relatively well despite the challenges. The Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback against major currencies is up 3.2% year-to-date, after rising 6.4% in 2021.

Despite weakening against the US dollar by 4.1% in 2021, the ringgit was stronger against the euro and the yen by 4.2% and 6.7% respectively. For this year, the ringgit continues to show strength against the euro and the yen, appreciating by 1.8% and 4.2% respectively but remained weaker against the greenback with a decline of 1.3%.

Against regional currencies, except with a 6.7% gain on the Thai baht in 2021, the ringgit has been weaker against most Asian units last year and this year.

Overall, in 2022, it will be a firmer recovery in Malaysia’s GDP. This is supported by external and domestic factors amid a challenging environment. Major contributors to growth include continued expansion in external demand, the reopening of international borders coupled with high vaccination rates, and improvement in employment and income prospects.
